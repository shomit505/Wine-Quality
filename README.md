Global warming is altering local climates more rapidly than anticipated. Traditional wine-producing regions may soon become too hot to sustain vineyards, while areas with limited winemaking history will need to adapt to meet rising demand. Motivated by this, I am exploring supervised learning methods to model user wine preferences, aiming to understand and predict how these changes might influence consumer tastes and market trends.
